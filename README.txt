README - USAGE
Upon clicking the green run arrow button in Android studio, 
or tapping the application icon on an android device the application will launch. 
In the home screen tap “Blast off” to start the game. Then you will have to
choose a game mode to play in ie. single vs multiplayer mode. Then you will choose
the number of cards in your deck: 8, 16 or 20. To play the game tap pairs of cards of the
same suit until all cards are gone. For every turn, your score goes up, the fewer turns it 
takes you to remove all cards, the better your score!
